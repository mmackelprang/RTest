TSWEB API MAPPING - QUICK REFERENCE
====================================

OVERALL STATUS:
- Total Endpoints Analyzed: 102+
- Fully Compatible: 7 endpoints (7%)
- Partial Match: 20 endpoints (20%)
- Missing in C#: 21 endpoints (21%)
- C# Only: 49 endpoints (48%)
- SignalR Implementations: 5 hubs

CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES (Must Implement):
1. Radio Presets System (GET/POST/DELETE /radio/presets)
2. File Management System (GET/POST /files, /files/play, /files/queue)
3. System Stats (GET /system/stats - CPU, RAM, uptime)
4. System Logs (GET /system/logs - with filtering)
5. Source Switching (Complete the 501 implementation)
6. Configuration Updates (Complete the 501 implementation)

TOP RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Add separate REST endpoints matching TypeScript spec (/api/playback/*)
2. Implement radio preset management system
3. Implement file browser and playback system
4. Add system monitoring endpoints
5. Update TypeScript spec to include all C# features

IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Critical missing features
Phase 2 (Week 3): System monitoring
Phase 3 (Week 4): API normalization
Phase 4 (Week 5): Documentation
Phase 5 (Week 6+): Blazor integration

STRENGTHS OF C# IMPLEMENTATION:
- Excellent Spotify OAuth with PKCE
- Comprehensive queue management
- Advanced metrics system
- Real-time SignalR hubs
- Detailed play history tracking
- Device management APIs

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review TSWEB_API_MAPPING.md for full details
2. Prioritize radio presets and file management
3. Complete partial implementations
4. Add endpoint aliases for consistency
5. Update TypeScript spec with C# features

See TSWEB_API_MAPPING.md for complete analysis and recommendations.
