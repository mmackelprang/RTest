# Future Work — Stubbed & Unimplemented Features

This document catalogs features that have been designed at the interface level but not yet fully implemented. Each entry includes the rationale for the stub, the platform APIs needed to complete it, and any known gotchas.

> **Rule:** When a feature is stubbed rather than implemented, it must be documented here with enough context for a future developer (or LLM) to pick it up without re-researching the problem.

## 1. Bluetooth AVRCP Volume Sync — Windows

**Status:** Linux fully implemented; Windows still stubbed
**Added:** 2026-02-11 (Phase 3 of audio-latency-research-and-fixes)
**Updated:** 2026-02-12 — Linux implementation complete
**Priority:** Low — Linux (Pi target) is done; Windows is dev-only

### What's Implemented (Linux)

Bidirectional AVRCP volume sync via BlueZ `MediaTransport1` D-Bus interface:
- `LinuxBluetoothService.AttachMediaTransportAsync()` — attaches to `MediaTransport1` when A2DP transport appears
- `OnTransportPropertiesChanged()` — fires `VolumeChanged` event when phone volume changes
- `SetDeviceVolumeAsync()` — sets BlueZ volume (0-127) via D-Bus property
- `AudioStateUpdateService` — subscribes to `VolumeChanged`, syncs to `MasterVolume`, and pushes console volume changes back to the BT device

### What's Needed — Windows

Windows stub (`WindowsBluetoothService`) still needs implementation using NAudio CoreAudioApi:

```csharp
// NAudio CoreAudioApi — find the BT audio endpoint
using NAudio.CoreAudioApi;
var enumerator = new MMDeviceEnumerator();
var btEndpoint = enumerator.EnumerateAudioEndPoints(DataFlow.Render, DeviceState.Active)
    .FirstOrDefault(d => d.FriendlyName.Contains(btDeviceName));
float volume = btEndpoint.AudioEndpointVolume.MasterVolumeLevelScalar; // 0.0-1.0
```

**Gotchas:**
- Must be under `#if WINDOWS_TARGET` — NAudio.CoreAudioApi requires Windows
- The BT endpoint may not appear immediately after `AudioPlaybackConnection.Open()`
- `MMDeviceEnumerator` is COM — must be created on an STA thread
- The endpoint may change if the user switches BT codecs (SBC→AAC)

## 2. Radio Device Switching (API)

**Status:** Validates request, returns device info, does not switch
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Priority:** Low — RF320 is the only radio hardware; SDR radio uses a separate source

### What Exists

| File | What's There |
|------|-------------|
| `Radio.API/Controllers/RadioController.cs:845-858` | `POST /api/radio/device/select` — validates device type, checks availability via `_radioFactory.IsDeviceAvailable()`, returns `RadioDeviceInfoDto` with `IsActive = false` |

### What's Needed

The controller needs to call `AudioManager.GetOrCreateSourceAsync(AudioSourceType.Radio)` with the selected device type. This requires:

1. `IRadioFactory.CreateRadioSource(deviceType)` already exists and works
2. The `AudioManager` would need a way to recreate the Radio source with a different device type (currently the source is cached — switching device type requires evicting the cached source)
3. Consider: should switching radio device type stop the current radio and create a new one, or hot-swap?

**Gotchas:**
- The current `_sourceCache` in AudioManager uses `AudioSourceType` as key — both RTL-SDR and RF320 are `AudioSourceType.Radio`. Switching between them requires cache eviction and source disposal.
- RF320 requires physical power — software can't start it. SDR can be started/stopped programmatically.

## 3. RF320 Radio Software Control

**Status:** Fully stubbed — hardware limitation, not a software gap
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Priority:** None — this is a hardware constraint, not future work

### What Exists

`Radio.Infrastructure/Audio/Sources/Primary/RadioAudioSource.cs` — The RF320BT is a vintage Bluetooth-controlled radio with USB audio output. It has no software-controllable tuner. All control methods (`SetFrequencyAsync`, `StepFrequencyUpAsync`, `SetBandAsync`, `StartScanAsync`, `TogglePowerStateAsync`, etc.) are no-ops that log warnings.

**This is intentional and permanent.** The RF320 can only be controlled via its physical knobs and the RaddyRF320BT Bluetooth protocol (separate git submodule). If SDR radio support is the active device, these methods are handled by `SDRRadioAudioSource` which fully implements them.

No further action needed unless a new radio hardware type is added.

## 4. TTS Audio Cache

**Status:** Cache key computed, lookup not implemented
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Priority:** Low — TTS is used infrequently (announcements, alerts)

### What Exists

| File | What's There |
|------|-------------|
| `Radio.Infrastructure/Audio/Services/TTSFactory.cs:91-102` | Computes `cacheKey = $"{engine}_{voice}_{text.GetHashCode()}"`, sets `isCached = false` always, increments cache hit/miss metrics |

### What's Needed

1. Define a cache directory (e.g., `./data/tts-cache/`)
2. On synthesis, save the audio stream to `{cacheDirectory}/{cacheKey}.wav` (or `.mp3`)
3. On lookup, check if `{cacheDirectory}/{cacheKey}.wav` exists and return it
4. Add TTL-based cleanup (similar to `AlbumArtCacheService` pattern — SHA256 content-addressed, 7-day TTL)
5. Consider cache invalidation when voice settings change

**Gotchas:**
- `text.GetHashCode()` is not deterministic across .NET processes/versions — use SHA256 of the text instead
- Cache should include voice parameters (speed, pitch) in the key, not just engine+voice+text
- Audio format should match what the TTS source expects (PCM WAV at engine sample rate)

## 5. Kiosk Mode (Fullscreen Browser)

**Status:** Deferred — infrastructure ready (dual-service deployment), UI not yet validated on Pi
**Added:** 2026-02-13
**Priority:** Medium — needed for the final console radio experience, but deferred until all testing/debugging/validation is complete on the Pi

### What Exists

The Radio.Web Blazor Server UI runs as a separate systemd service (`radio-web.service`) on port 5002. The Pi's touchscreen display (1920x576) can access it via any browser.

### What's Needed

A kiosk mode setup that launches Chromium in fullscreen `--app` mode pointing at the local Web UI, auto-starting on boot.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Auto-login for the display user** (e.g., `pi` or a dedicated `kiosk` user):

```bash
# /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/autologin.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin pi --noclear %I $TERM
```

2. **Chromium kiosk systemd user service** (`~/.config/systemd/user/radio-kiosk.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Radio Console Kiosk Browser
After=graphical-session.target
Wants=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/chromium-browser --kiosk --app=http://localhost:5002 --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --disable-session-crashed-bubble --check-for-update-interval=31536000
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

3. **Disable screen blanking / power management:**

```bash
# /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart (add these lines)
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
```

4. **Hide mouse cursor** (for touchscreen):

```bash
apt install unclutter
# Add to autostart: @unclutter -idle 0.1 -root
```

#### Gotchas

- Chromium `--kiosk` vs `--app`: `--kiosk` is true fullscreen (no window chrome, no way to exit without keyboard). `--app` shows minimal chrome but allows window management. For a console radio, `--kiosk` is preferred.
- The `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5` ensures the X server and radio-web service are fully up before Chromium launches. May need adjustment.
- On Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm with Wayland (labwc), the approach differs — use `wlr-randr` for display config and ensure Chromium runs under Wayland.
- If using X11 (default on Pi OS Bookworm desktop), ensure LightDM auto-login is configured in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` under `[Seat:*]`.
- The 1920x576 ultrawide touchscreen may need custom display configuration via `xrandr` or `/boot/config.txt` HDMI settings.
- Consider adding a health-check loop that restarts Chromium if it crashes or if the Web UI becomes unresponsive.
