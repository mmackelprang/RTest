# Future Work — Stubbed & Unimplemented Features

This document catalogs features that have been designed at the interface level but not yet fully implemented. Each entry includes the rationale for the stub, the platform APIs needed to complete it, and any known gotchas.

> **Rule:** When a feature is stubbed rather than implemented, it must be documented here with enough context for a future developer (or LLM) to pick it up without re-researching the problem.

## 1. Bluetooth AVRCP Volume Sync — Windows

**Status:** Linux fully implemented; Windows still stubbed
**Added:** 2026-02-11 (Phase 3 of audio-latency-research-and-fixes)
**Updated:** 2026-02-12 — Linux implementation complete
**Priority:** Low — Linux (Pi target) is done; Windows is dev-only

### What's Implemented (Linux)

Bidirectional AVRCP volume sync via BlueZ `MediaTransport1` D-Bus interface:
- `LinuxBluetoothService.AttachMediaTransportAsync()` — attaches to `MediaTransport1` when A2DP transport appears
- `OnTransportPropertiesChanged()` — fires `VolumeChanged` event when phone volume changes
- `SetDeviceVolumeAsync()` — sets BlueZ volume (0-127) via D-Bus property
- `AudioStateUpdateService` — subscribes to `VolumeChanged`, syncs to `MasterVolume`, and pushes console volume changes back to the BT device

### What's Needed — Windows

Windows stub (`WindowsBluetoothService`) still needs implementation using NAudio CoreAudioApi:

```csharp
// NAudio CoreAudioApi — find the BT audio endpoint
using NAudio.CoreAudioApi;
var enumerator = new MMDeviceEnumerator();
var btEndpoint = enumerator.EnumerateAudioEndPoints(DataFlow.Render, DeviceState.Active)
    .FirstOrDefault(d => d.FriendlyName.Contains(btDeviceName));
float volume = btEndpoint.AudioEndpointVolume.MasterVolumeLevelScalar; // 0.0-1.0
```

**Gotchas:**
- Must be under `#if WINDOWS_TARGET` — NAudio.CoreAudioApi requires Windows
- The BT endpoint may not appear immediately after `AudioPlaybackConnection.Open()`
- `MMDeviceEnumerator` is COM — must be created on an STA thread
- The endpoint may change if the user switches BT codecs (SBC→AAC)

## 2. Radio Device Switching (API)

**Status:** Validates request, returns device info, does not switch
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Priority:** Low — RF320 is the only radio hardware; SDR radio uses a separate source

### What Exists

| File | What's There |
|------|-------------|
| `Radio.API/Controllers/RadioController.cs:845-858` | `POST /api/radio/device/select` — validates device type, checks availability via `_radioFactory.IsDeviceAvailable()`, returns `RadioDeviceInfoDto` with `IsActive = false` |

### What's Needed

The controller needs to call `AudioManager.GetOrCreateSourceAsync(AudioSourceType.Radio)` with the selected device type. This requires:

1. `IRadioFactory.CreateRadioSource(deviceType)` already exists and works
2. The `AudioManager` would need a way to recreate the Radio source with a different device type (currently the source is cached — switching device type requires evicting the cached source)
3. Consider: should switching radio device type stop the current radio and create a new one, or hot-swap?

**Gotchas:**
- The current `_sourceCache` in AudioManager uses `AudioSourceType` as key — both RTL-SDR and RF320 are `AudioSourceType.Radio`. Switching between them requires cache eviction and source disposal.
- RF320 requires physical power — software can't start it. SDR can be started/stopped programmatically.

## 3. RF320 Radio Software Control

**Status:** Fully stubbed — hardware limitation, not a software gap
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Priority:** None — this is a hardware constraint, not future work

### What Exists

`Radio.Infrastructure/Audio/Sources/Primary/RadioAudioSource.cs` — The RF320BT is a vintage Bluetooth-controlled radio with USB audio output. It has no software-controllable tuner. All control methods (`SetFrequencyAsync`, `StepFrequencyUpAsync`, `SetBandAsync`, `StartScanAsync`, `TogglePowerStateAsync`, etc.) are no-ops that log warnings.

**This is intentional and permanent.** The RF320 can only be controlled via its physical knobs and the RaddyRF320BT Bluetooth protocol (separate git submodule). If SDR radio support is the active device, these methods are handled by `SDRRadioAudioSource` which fully implements them.

No further action needed unless a new radio hardware type is added.

## 4. TTS Audio Cache

**Status:** Cache key computed, lookup not implemented
**Added:** 2026-02-11
**Priority:** Low — TTS is used infrequently (announcements, alerts)

### What Exists

| File | What's There |
|------|-------------|
| `Radio.Infrastructure/Audio/Services/TTSFactory.cs:91-102` | Computes `cacheKey = $"{engine}_{voice}_{text.GetHashCode()}"`, sets `isCached = false` always, increments cache hit/miss metrics |

### What's Needed

1. Define a cache directory (e.g., `./data/tts-cache/`)
2. On synthesis, save the audio stream to `{cacheDirectory}/{cacheKey}.wav` (or `.mp3`)
3. On lookup, check if `{cacheDirectory}/{cacheKey}.wav` exists and return it
4. Add TTL-based cleanup (similar to `AlbumArtCacheService` pattern — SHA256 content-addressed, 7-day TTL)
5. Consider cache invalidation when voice settings change

**Gotchas:**
- `text.GetHashCode()` is not deterministic across .NET processes/versions — use SHA256 of the text instead
- Cache should include voice parameters (speed, pitch) in the key, not just engine+voice+text
- Audio format should match what the TTS source expects (PCM WAV at engine sample rate)

## 5. Kiosk Mode (Fullscreen Browser)

**Status:** Deferred — infrastructure ready (dual-service deployment), UI not yet validated on Pi
**Added:** 2026-02-13
**Priority:** Medium — needed for the final console radio experience, but deferred until all testing/debugging/validation is complete on the Pi

### What Exists

The Radio.Web Blazor Server UI runs as a separate systemd service (`radio-web.service`) on port 5002. The Pi's touchscreen display (1920x576) can access it via any browser.

### What's Needed

A kiosk mode setup that launches Chromium in fullscreen `--app` mode pointing at the local Web UI, auto-starting on boot.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Auto-login for the display user** (e.g., `pi` or a dedicated `kiosk` user):

```bash
# /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/autologin.conf
[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --autologin pi --noclear %I $TERM
```

2. **Chromium kiosk systemd user service** (`~/.config/systemd/user/radio-kiosk.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Radio Console Kiosk Browser
After=graphical-session.target
Wants=graphical-session.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Environment=DISPLAY=:0
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/chromium-browser --kiosk --app=http://localhost:5002 --noerrdialogs --disable-infobars --disable-session-crashed-bubble --check-for-update-interval=31536000
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=graphical-session.target
```

3. **Disable screen blanking / power management:**

```bash
# /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart (add these lines)
@xset s off
@xset -dpms
@xset s noblank
```

4. **Hide mouse cursor** (for touchscreen):

```bash
apt install unclutter
# Add to autostart: @unclutter -idle 0.1 -root
```

#### Gotchas

- Chromium `--kiosk` vs `--app`: `--kiosk` is true fullscreen (no window chrome, no way to exit without keyboard). `--app` shows minimal chrome but allows window management. For a console radio, `--kiosk` is preferred.
- The `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 5` ensures the X server and radio-web service are fully up before Chromium launches. May need adjustment.
- On Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm with Wayland (labwc), the approach differs — use `wlr-randr` for display config and ensure Chromium runs under Wayland.
- If using X11 (default on Pi OS Bookworm desktop), ensure LightDM auto-login is configured in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` under `[Seat:*]`.
- The 1920x576 ultrawide touchscreen may need custom display configuration via `xrandr` or `/boot/config.txt` HDMI settings.
- Consider adding a health-check loop that restarts Chromium if it crashes or if the Web UI becomes unresponsive.

## 6. Google Cast Custom Web Receiver — Low-Latency Streaming

**Status:** Receiver HTML created, not yet registered with Google
**Added:** 2026-02-16 (Phase 11.2 Cast latency reduction)
**Priority:** Medium — eliminates 10-15s Cast buffering delay; code-side changes already reduce ceremony from ~15s to ~8s

### What Exists

| File | What's There |
|------|-------------|
| `deploy/cast-receiver/receiver.html` | Complete CAF Custom Web Receiver with low-latency buffer config |
| `Radio.Core/Configuration/AudioOutputOptions.cs` | `GoogleCastOutputOptions.ApplicationId` — configurable app ID (default: `CC1AD845`) |
| `Radio.Infrastructure/Audio/Outputs/GoogleCastOutput.cs` | Uses `_options.ApplicationId` for all `LaunchApplicationAsync()` calls |
| `Radio.API/appsettings.json` | `AudioOutput.GoogleCast.ApplicationId` setting |

### How the Custom Receiver Reduces Latency

The Default Media Receiver (CC1AD845) has a hardcoded 10-15 second audio prefill buffer. For live radio streams, this creates unacceptable delay. The custom receiver uses CAF (Cast Application Framework) with:

- `initialPlaybackWatermark = 0.2` — start playback after just 200ms of buffered audio (vs 10-15s default)
- `resumePlaybackWatermark = 0.5` — resume after rebuffer with only 500ms
- `disableIdleTimeout: true` — keeps receiver alive for continuous streams
- `StreamType.LIVE` already enforced by our sender code

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Host `receiver.html` on HTTPS

Google Cast requires the receiver URL to be served over HTTPS. The simplest free option is GitHub Pages:

1. In your GitHub repo, go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Choose the `main` branch and `/deploy/cast-receiver` folder (or push `receiver.html` to a `docs/` folder on `main` if your repo structure requires it)
4. Click **Save** — GitHub will deploy to `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/receiver.html`
5. Verify the URL loads in a browser — you should see a dark page with "Radio Console" text

Alternative: If GitHub Pages doesn't suit your setup, any static HTTPS host works (Firebase Hosting free tier, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, etc.).

#### Step 2: Create a Google Cast Developer Account

1. Go to the [Google Cast SDK Developer Console](https://cast.google.com/publish/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Pay the **one-time $5 registration fee** (non-refundable)
4. **Important**: The email address cannot be changed after account creation — use the account you want to own this long-term

#### Step 3: Register the Custom Receiver Application

1. From the Developer Console, click **Add New Application**
2. Select **Custom Receiver**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `Radio Console` (displayed briefly while the receiver loads on Cast devices)
   - **URL**: Your HTTPS receiver URL from Step 1 (e.g., `https://yourname.github.io/RTest/receiver.html`)
   - **Relay casting**: Leave **disabled** (not needed for local network streaming)
   - **Audio-only devices**: **Enable** — this allows Cast to audio-only devices like speakers and smart displays in audio mode
4. Click **Save**
5. **Copy the Application ID** shown (e.g., `A1B2C3D4`) — you'll need this for configuration

#### Step 4: Register Your Cast Device for Testing

Unpublished apps only work on devices whose serial numbers are registered in the console.

1. In the Developer Console, click **Add New Device**
2. Find your Chromecast's serial number:
   - **Chromecast/Chromecast Audio**: Printed on the back of the device, or:
     - Open the Google Home app → tap your device → tap the gear icon → scroll to "Cast firmware version" area where serial is shown
   - **Android TV / Google TV**: Settings → System → About → Status → Serial number (use the **Cast serial number**, not hardware serial)
   - **Smart speakers/displays**: Open the Google Home app → tap your device → gear icon → scroll to serial number
3. Enter the **serial number** and a **description** (e.g., "Living Room Chromecast")
4. Click **OK**
5. **Wait 15 minutes** for registration to propagate
6. **Reboot your Cast device** — unplug power, wait 10 seconds, plug back in
7. The device status in the console should change to **"Ready for Testing"**

#### Step 5: Configure Radio Console to Use the Custom Receiver

Update `appsettings.json` (or the Pi's deployed config) with your new Application ID:

```json
"AudioOutput": {
  "GoogleCast": {
    "ApplicationId": "A1B2C3D4"
  }
}
```

Replace `A1B2C3D4` with the actual ID from Step 3. Then restart the Radio.API service.

#### Step 6: Verify It Works

1. Start Radio.API and Radio.Web
2. Open the Web UI → go to the Cast/Output section
3. Select your Cast device and connect
4. Play any audio source — audio should start on the Cast device within **1-3 seconds** instead of the 10-15 second delay with the default receiver
5. If something goes wrong, revert `ApplicationId` to `"CC1AD845"` to fall back to the default media receiver

#### Step 7: Publish (Optional)

Once tested and working, you can publish so the app works on **all** Cast devices without serial number registration:

1. In the Developer Console, click **Edit** on your application
2. Fill in the required listing details:
   - **Category**: Music & Audio
   - **Title**: `Radio Console` (≤50 chars)
   - **Description**: `Low-latency audio streaming for Radio Console` (≤80 chars)
   - **Icon**: Upload a 512×512 PNG icon
3. Click **Save**, then **Publish**
4. The app becomes available to all Cast devices worldwide (takes a few minutes to propagate)

### Gotchas

- **HTTPS required**: Cast receivers must be served over HTTPS. `http://` URLs are rejected by the Cast SDK.
- **Test device registration**: Unpublished custom receivers only work on devices registered in the Cast SDK Console. After registering, **reboot the Chromecast** for the change to take effect.
- **Registration propagation**: New app IDs can take 5-15 minutes to propagate to Cast devices after registration.
- **CAF v3 only**: The receiver uses CAF v3 (`cast_receiver_framework.js`). Do not use the deprecated v2 receiver SDK.
- **Fallback**: If the custom receiver has issues, revert `ApplicationId` to `"CC1AD845"` to use the default media receiver (with higher latency).
